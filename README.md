itop_modules
============

These are iTop customization modules created for need in my work which may be useful to others. These have been so far tested working with iTop version 2.1.0

- wirelesslan module - For simple wireless SSID settings

- ipdevices module - For documenting IP connected devices such as IPcameras, Biometrics, etc.

- paneldevices module - My lame attempt to provide cabling infrastructure CMDB options
	- these include PatchPanels, Floor Panels, Panel Interfaces and Patch Cables

- datamodels - these are the updates on the iTop configuration which are required for the above modules to work
